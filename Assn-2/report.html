    <p><b><centre> General Discussion of Ford Fulkerson Algorithm </centre></b></p>
    <p>The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm was published in 1956 in the Canadian Journal of Mathematics in the paper titled
       'Maximal Flow Through A Network' authored by L. R. Ford Jr. and D. R. Fulkerson. Idea behind the algorithm : 
       We can send flow along one of the paths provided that the path starts from the source and extends to the sink 
       with capacity available on all edges in the path</p>

    <p><u>Max Flow Min Cut Theorem</u></p>
    <p>As per the max-flow min-cut theorem, in a flow network ' the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the
       sink is equal to the total weight of the edges in the minimum cut'. The minimum cut is the smallest total weight of
        the edges which if removed would disconnect the source from the sink.</p>

    <p><u>Key Terms</u></p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Capacity condition 0&#60;f(e)&#60;c(e)</li>
      <li>Conservation condition Σe_into_vf(e)=Σe_outof_vf(e)</li>
      <li>Augmenting path:-is a simple s to t path on the residual graph</li>
      <li>Bottleneck capacity:-is the minimum residual capacity on an augmenting path</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p><u>Key Observations</u></p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>At every intermediate stage of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the flow values {f(e)} and the residual capacities
         in Gf are integers</li>
      <li>The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm terminates in at most C iterations of the while loop and thus the total time taken
         is O(mC) where C is the max flow value</li>
      <li>If e, e' are anti-parallel edges(i.e. one is forward edge and one is backward edge) in a flow network, there
         exists a max-flow in which atleast one of e , e' has no flow through it</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><u>Max Flow Min Cut Problem has several Applications such as:</u></p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Menger's theorem:-Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and two vertices t and s,the problem is to find the maximum
         number of edge-disjoint s-t paths in G</li>
      <li>Project selection problem:- Given n projects and m machines, revenue r(pi) for each project pi and costs c(qj) for
         each machine qj , select projects and machines to purchase such that it results in maximum profit. Every project requires
          a certain number of machines and each machine could be shared by several projects</li>
      <li>Image segmentation problem:- Given n pixels, each of which can be assigned a foreground value fi or a background value bi.
         A penalty of pij is awarded if pixels i, j are adjacent and have different assignments. The problem is to assign pixels to
          foreground or background such that the sum of their values minus the penalties is maximum</li>
      <li>Maximum Bipartite Matching:- A matching in a Bipartite Graph is a set of the edges selected such that no two edges share
         an endpoint. A maximum matching is a matching with maximum number of edges</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><u>Issues in Coding</u></p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>There was not a specific format for the datasets, thus we had modify our code and the file accordingly to ascertain 
        a specific format</li>
    </ul></p>
